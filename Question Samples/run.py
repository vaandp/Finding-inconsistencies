Script summary
--------------
This script runs GRASP (or another LLM-based pipeline) over one or more CSV datasets
and writes one JSON output file per row.

Key features:
- Supports the CompMix CSV schema with at least:
      question_id, question, entity_id1, ...
- For each row, builds the LLM input by concatenating:
      input_text = "<question> <entity_id1>"
  so that the (first) entity ID is explicitly included as a token for the model.
- Output filenames are:
      <question_id>.json
  e.g. question_id = 97 -> filename: 97.json
- Processes rows in batches to rehearse large-scale workflow:
      BATCH_SIZE = 2
  After each batch:
    * All rows in that batch have been processed and written to disk.
    * A `batch_log.txt` file is appended with a line describing which rows and
      files were produced for that batch.
    * A Git commit is created and pushed:
          git add -A
          git commit -m "finished kth batch, generated X/Y JSON files"
          git push origin main
      Any git errors are logged but DO NOT stop the main processing.
- Uses a tqdm progress bar to show overall processing progress.
- Prints a concise summary at the end with counts and output directory.
- The code is structured so that multiple CSVs can be handled in the future:
      compmix-test.csv, dev_set.csv, test_set.csv, train_set.csv
  For now only top1000.csv is active.

Resume & quality checks:
- On each run, the script checks the output dir and `batch_log.txt`.
  * If it finds that all rows are already processed, it prompts:
        "file already generated, do you want to update them? [y/n]"
    If you answer:
        - 'n': the script skips re-processing that CSV.
        - 'y': the script re-processes from scratch (overwriting outputs).
  * If it finds that only part of the CSV was processed, it resumes from the
    first unprocessed row, based on `batch_log.txt`.
- It also scans all processed JSON outputs to detect "bad executions", defined as:
    - JSON missing / invalid, or
    - JSON object with type="output", task="sparql-qa", and output is null.
  * These are logged to `bad_executions.csv`.
  * You are asked:
        "Detected N bad executions (...) Do you want to re-run them? [y/n]"
    If:
        - 'y': those rows are treated as unprocessed and will be re-run.
        - 'n': they are ignored and the script continues from the last row.
